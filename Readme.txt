This project builds a machine-learning model (Ridge Regression) to estimate YouTube video ad-revenue based on video performance metrics.
The workflow contains two main components:

1) Jupyter Notebook - training, EDA, preprocessing, model creation
2) Streamlit App - interactive prediction UI (app.py)

Steps:
1) Run cells in yt_file.ipynb
2) Run streamlit app by pasting the following code in the VSC terminal: python -m streamlit run app.py
